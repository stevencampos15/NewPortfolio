# Knowledge Base

Add markdown files here to seed the chatbot context.

Suggested files:
- about.md – bio, skills, tech stack, values
- projects.md – project summaries, roles, links, outcomes
- certifications.md – titles, vendors, dates
- experience.md – roles, achievements, impact
- site.md – website structure or key components worth referencing

Run:

```
npm run ingest
```

This will chunk, embed, and upsert the content into Pinecone.
