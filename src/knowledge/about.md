I'm from Santa Tecla, El Salvador, with an Information Technology degree. My tech journey spans web development, server management, and cybersecurity.



I'm a cybersecurity professional with 5+ years of experience securing digital systems and networks. I've worked hands-on managing firewalls, EDR solutions, antivirus tools, WAFs, and load balancers, while also administering servers, endpoints, Active Directory, and GPOs to build resilient infrastructures.



I hold multiple cybersecurity certifications, including Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) by ISCÂ², and I'm passionate about staying ahead in a fast-changing threat landscape. I believe that continuous learning and creative problem-solving are key to delivering security solutions that truly make a difference.
